This JS scripts are for beginner and can run inside google scripts.

Monday.com export is a crap, it doesn't export properly as a database. So I coded this scripts that may live in google script and run itself from time to time.

This code intends to extract all data from a Monday.com board and load into a googlesheet
The GraphQL API version is already depricated, the hieranchy groups/board/items... is changed. This is the new version 2023-10 (https://developer.monday.com/api-reference/docs/migrating-to-v-2023-10)
To learn more about GraphQL, pls visit this page (https://graphql.org/learn/)

This is the Monday.com API documentation if you are interested to read (https://developer.monday.com/api-reference/docs/basics)

If you want to contribute, pls contact me and we can update this code.

Cheers!
Ivan
